Description: Generate random numbers from the Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom 
    Number Generator (CSPRNG) provided by the underlying operating system.  
    System CSPRNGs are seeded internally by the OS with entropy it gathers
    from the system hardware. The following system functions are used:
    arc4random_buf() on macOS and BSD; BCryptgenRandom() on Windows; 
    Sys_getrandom() on Linux.
