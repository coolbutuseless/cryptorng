Description: Generate random bytes from the Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom 
    Number Generator ('CSPRNG') provided by the underlying operating system.  
    These system 'CSPRNGs' are seeded internally by entropy gathered by the 'OS'
    and use random number generation algorithms which are considered cryptographically secure.  
    On 'macOS' and 'BSD' systems 'arc4random_buf' is used; 'Windows' uses
    'BCryptgenRandom()'; and 'Linux' uses 'Sys_getrandom()'.
