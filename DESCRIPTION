Description: Generate random bytes from the Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom 
    Number Generator (CSPRNG) provided by the underlying operating system.  
    These system CSPRNGs are seeded internally by the OS with entropy it gathers
    and use random number generation algorithms which are considered cryptographically secure.  
    On macOS and BSD systems arc4random_buf is used; Windows uses
    BCryptgenRandom; and Linux uses Sys_getrandom.
